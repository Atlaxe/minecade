# Look and feel

How Minecade talks to players and how its lobby UI is built. Later parts of the UI pass (the
terminal, hologram and menus) add their sections here.

## Messages and colors

Every message players read (chat, titles, the action bar) goes through
`packages/minigame-core/src/text.ts`, so the whole network uses one palette:

| Helper | Color | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `say.minor` | gray (§7) | Minor notes: "You're spectating", "Wrapping up the last game" |
| `say.info` | aqua (§b) | Information: waiting for players, "Starting Sumo..." |
| `say.important` | blue (§9) | Important news: who's starting a game, round winners |
| `say.success` | green (§a) | Good news: "Go!", "Victory!" |
| `say.warn` / `say.error` | red (§c) | Warnings and errors: not enough players, a failed start |
| `say.highlight` | yellow (§e) | Highlights: countdown numbers, winners, the kill feed |

`nameOf(name, color?)` writes a player or team name in its team color (white without a team).
A name inside a `say.*` line hands the line's color back after itself, so this stays aqua:

```ts
say.info(`${nameOf("Alex")} is starting Sumo.`)
```

`stripColors(text)` removes the codes, for logs and tests (tests compare what players see).

## Kill feed

When a player goes down, the game broadcasts one line:

- **With a killer:** `<victim> was <verb> by <killer>`, the verb picked at random from
  `KILL_VERBS` (obliterated, dominated, man-handled, bonked, ...). The line is yellow, the victim
  is gray and the killer red, or both in their team colors in team games.
- **Without a killer:** a line picked by cause: falling into the void or off the map
  ("took a long walk off a short platform"), fall damage, or a generic one.

A game can add its own verbs, or use only its own, in `game.config.ts`:

```ts
deathMessages: { verbs: ["painted", "splattered"] }                 // added to the defaults
deathMessages: { verbs: ["painted"], replace: true }                // only these
deathMessages: { noKiller: ["fell off the plot"] }                  // lines with no killer
```

For anything more (a line that depends on the weapon, say), override
`protected deathMessage(victim, down)` in the game's `Minigame` class. Returning `undefined`
skips the line.

## Action bar

The action bar (the line above the hotbar) only shows what matters right now:

- **Lobby:** nothing, except "Starting <game>..." while a game is starting.
- **Games:** the stage clock in its last 30 seconds, lives in games with lives, and
  "Respawning in N" while respawning. A game can show more by overriding `hud(name)`.
